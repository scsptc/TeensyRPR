# TeensyRPR

TeensyRPR is kind of a hobbyist project to keep Robust Packet Radio (RPR) alive.

The project is based on the [Teensy 4.0](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html) board and the [Teensy audio shield](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy3_audio.html).
It can build completely upon these two modules. You then only need a PTT transistor an some kind of power supply.

The TeensyRPR firmware supports NMEA input and a LC display with ILI9341 controller.

The KiCad directory contains a KiCad project with the complete schematic. The KiCad project goes a step further and removes the need for the Teensy audio shield.
